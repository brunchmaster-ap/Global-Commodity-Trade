    "text": "Question\n\nDid the 2008 global financial crisis cause a long-term shift in U.S. live animal import behavior?\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Commodity Trade Statistics dataset was filtered to examine U.S. live animal imports from 2000 to 2016. After cleaning and isolating relevant records, we created indicators for post-2008 periods and grouped commodities to track trade behavior before and after the financial crisis.\nPreliminary results show notable shifts in import volumes and values following 2008, suggesting that the global financial crisis may have had a lasting effect on U.S. demand for live animals. This project explores whether these patterns reflect a temporary shock or a structural change in trade behavior."
