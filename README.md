# Global-Commodity-Trade Statistics

This project analyzes the Global Commodity Trade Statistics dataset, focusing on U.S. imports of live animals between 2000 and 2016. The goal is to uncover patterns in trade value and volume over time, particularly before and after the 2008 global financial crisis. By combining cleaned data with visual and statistical analysis, we explore whether the crisis triggered long-term changes in U.S. import behavior, helping reveal shifts in demand and market stability across different types of live animal commodities.
